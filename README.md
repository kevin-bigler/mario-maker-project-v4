# mario-maker-project-v4

Yep. I'm at it again. ;P

## Goals

I'd like to achieve certain functional and technical goals with this project.

### Functional

### Technical

- linting (eslint)
- babel transpiling
- integration test against _built_ (transpiled) code
- annotate types, potentially generated using json schema somehow
- static (compile-time) and dynamic (runtime) **type-checking** (partial/opt-in)
    - `flow` & `flow-runtime` look promising
